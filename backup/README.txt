== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is important to backup my website? =

The majority of people value their digital content, but are still not backing it up regularly. More than 50% of adults, personally have and/or know someone who has lost files.

The fact is that, even though today's technology is extraordinarily advanced and dependable, it can still fall subject to failure. So unless you have a routine backup solution, you're at risk of losing all of your data at a moment's notice.

= How often should a backup be created? =

It depends on how often data gets updated on your website. Maybe daily backups are not necessary and maybe monthly backups are not good enough, so the best way is measuring the amount of data that gets changed in your particular case.

= What is included in the basic (free) plan? =

JetBackup gives you the ability to backup or restore your website as many times as you want. You can also download your backups and import them in other websites where JetBackup is installed and running.

= Why should I purchase a JetBackup premium version? =

Although JetBackup gives you the ability to backup and restore your website as many times as you want, your backups will only reside on your server. With our premium plans you can upload your backups to the cloud of your preference, schedule your backups, receive notifications, and many other features.

That's not all, if you are a premium user, you will receive 15-minute response time priority support by our industry leading support team 24/7/365.

<a href="https://www.jetbackup.com/jetbackup-for-wordpress">JetBackup premium versions</a>

= What other platforms has JetBackup planned to support? =

We currently support WordPress and Magento platforms, but with the help of our flexible and universal backup technology, multi-platform coverage is just around the corner. Prestashop and Joomla are next.

= What are the minimum requirements for installing JetBackup? =

Your hosting/server must have installed PHP 5.3 or higher with zlib library enabled.

Note: depending on the product you are using, there more be more requirements, that's why we recommend you to check our products section for more details.

= What are the limitations of the backup created by JetBackup? =

Of course there is a limit regarding the size of the archive, but practically it is unreachable. We use our own SGBP archive format which compared to Zip doesn't limit you to 4GB archive/file size or 65k of number of files.

It doesn't matter if you are running 32-bit or 64-bit OS, if it's Linux, Windows or Mac, everything is the same.

= Something is not working, what should I do? =

No software is perfect and we are not the exception. There are tons of different servers and configurations and something may go wrong in one of them.

When you are facing an issue of any kind with any of our products, the first thing to do is <a href="https://www.jetbackup.com/jetbackup-for-wordpress/support">contacting us</a>. We are here to help you, give you tips, advices and even create fixes/patches or features whenever needed.

= How can I extract an SGBP file? =

SGBP is our own archive format, therefore currently there is no software that can extract it.

= Is it possible to migrate website using JetBackup? =

Although we don't offer a server migration feature on our free version, JetBackup creates an exact snapshot of the current state of your website and whenever you restore it, the exact same state gets restored. So practically, you can migrate your website with just downloading and importing your backup.

<p>
1. Click on the blue "Import" button.<br>
2. Browse the file in your local computer. There are 2 things to notice here: a) the maximum upload size will vary depending on the server your website is running on, b) a path is indicated where you can easily upload your file using an FTP client of your preference (the file will be automatically detected).<br>
3. Press the "Upload" button and wait for your file to be uploaded.

1. Localize the backup file you want to restore from.<br>
2. Click on the green restore button.<br>
3. After confirmation, the restore progress will start. Note: it is highly recommended that you don't do anything else during the restore progress, because the site is in alteration process and any secondary action can affect its correct restoration.
