Displays the currently installed PHP/MySQL version in the "At a Glance" admin dashboard widget.

== Description ==

Very lightweight and simple plugin that displays the currently installed PHP/MySQL version in the "At a Glance" admin dashboard widget.

In the latest plugin version you can also view the current MySQL version when hovering over the PHP version text. We chose to implement it this way as you may not need to know the MySQL version as often as the PHP version, and it just adds unnecessary visual noise.

Just hover over the PHP version label to display the installed MySQL version.

Also, on some Windows based servers the returned MySQL version can be displayed with a <code>5.5.5-</code> prefix which can be a little annoying, so this is removed for convenience.
