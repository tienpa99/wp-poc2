Metricool is the first tool designed to measure #Blog impact and #SocialMedia activity.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to connect your blog or web based on Wordpress with Metricool. Metricool is a tool that provides metrics and analytics about your blog and your social profiles. Using Metricool you can schedule your tweets or your posts in Facebook.

If you want to interrupt the conexion between your blog and Metricool, you can disable the plugin or remove the Metricool identifier configured in the plugin settings window.
