Gallery Custom Links allows you to link images from galleries to a specified URL. Tested with WordPress Gallery, Gutenberg, the Meow Gallery and others.

== Description ==

Gallery Custom Links allows you to link images from galleries to a specified URL. Tested with WordPress Gallery, Gutenberg, the Meow Gallery and others. The official page is here: [Gallery Custom Links](https://meowapps.com/gallery-custom-links/).

=== Usage ===

Two fields are added to your images, in your Media Library: Link URL and Link Target. If, at least, the Link URL is set up, this image will link to that URL every time it is used within a gallery. Lightbox will be automatically disabled for those images.

=== Compatibility ===

It currently works with the native WP Gallery, the Gutenberg Gallery, and the [Meow Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/). It should actually work with any gallery plugin using the 'gallery' class and Responsive Images (src-set). Let me know if you would like more galleries to be supported, it should be easy.

=== Filters ===

You can optimize (run the plugin only on the pages where you need it) and support more galleries (through CSS classes) easily by using filters. To know more about this, visit the official page, here: [Gallery Custom Links](https://meowapps.com/gallery-custom-links/).

=== Thanks ===

The motivation to build this plugin came from my users who had issues trying to use WP Gallery Custom Links. I realized that this plugin was working extremely well with the standard gallery, but would require too much rewriting for Gutenberg and other galleries, hence the creation of this plugin. I hope it will help.

Languages: English.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gallery-custom-links` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Upgrade Notice ==

Replace all the files. Nothing else to do.
