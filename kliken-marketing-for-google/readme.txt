### How it works

#### Promote your products and retarget visitors as they surf the Web
We help you find ideal new customers interested in your products and increase sales to existing site visitors with Kliken Ads for the Open Web. We put your products in front of customers that already love what you sell and are ready to purchase – giving you maximum exposure with a greater return on advertising spend.

Kliken Ads is the easiest, most affordable way to find new customers and increase sales. In less than 10 minutes, our customers can build a full campaign ready to go live, preview the campaign, select a budget to fit the business and start growing sales. Packages start at $5 per day.

#### Create or link your Google Merchant Center Account
We help you create or link your Woo store to the necessary accounts needed to get your products on Google. We also continue to optimize and manage these accounts so you don’t have to.

#### Optimize Smart Product feeds with daily inventory sync
Keeping your inventory up-to-date is easy with our automated product feed and daily syncs so you can make sure shoppers are only seeing your in-stock products when they find you on Google.

#### Access free listings on the Google Shopping tab and surfaces across Google
When eligible merchants sign up for Google Shopping, they automatically opt into free listings so that they can potentially show up on [surfaces across Google](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9199328) or the [Google Shopping tab](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9838672?hl=en) to drive free traffic to their approved products.

Learn more about free listings [here](https://www.blog.google/products/shopping/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google/) and access the help center [here](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9838672).

#### Run paid Google Shopping Ads campaign to show up across Google Shopping, Search, YouTube, Gmail, and the Google Display Network
Google Shopping Ads campaigns (also called Performance Max Campaigns) help increase your sales and revenue by displaying your products to interested shoppers strategically across Google to drive traffic and sales.

Select which categories you want to advertise and the extension will generate Google Shopping feeds that automatically manage ad creation, targeting, bidding, budget allocation, sales, and conversions.


### Kliken's AI Powered Marketing Pricing

#### The Kliken automation fee is $10 per month

The automation fee covers everything you need to be successful on Google, Facebook and the Open Web.
