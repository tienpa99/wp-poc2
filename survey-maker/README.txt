= MULTI-PAGE SURVEYS, UNLIMITED SECTIONS =
The **#1 Plugin** for creating **multi-step forms**. Organize and group the questions into separate sections within the survey. Break down your survey into separate pages with the help of this functionality in order to make it engaging and interesting to take. You can choose a different number of questions to be shown per page. Moreover, the survey plugin allows you to re-arrange questions within a section by drag and dropping it. You can give a title to the section, write a brief description, and add as many questions as you want. You can create **unlimited questions**, **unlimited sections**, and **unlimited surveys** with our Survey form maker.
JavaScript coding is implemented for changing the sections in the front-end.


= SUBMISSIONS AND REAL-TIME REPORTING =
Are you planning to receive LARGE Data while conducting your survey? However, you do not have enough time to read them one by one or not all questions' answers are important to be viewed. *So it's not the volume of data that's important, but what companies or individual conductors do with the data is matters.* And here, the Survey Maker comes to be of help. Our reports, charts, and statistics will help you to analyze and interpret the data without any third-party tool.
So, the Survey Maker plugin is the best solution for those companies who employ a **data-driven approach**.


= ADVANCED STYLES =
The WordPress Survey plugin can be used for companies as well as for individual research conductors. Whether you're conducting research or collecting feedback, you can create engaging online surveys with our survey builder plugin. It offers **6 themes** for creating interactive surveys that keep survey takers engaged: **Classic Light, Classic Dark, Minimal, Modern, Business, Elegant**.
*The plugin is fully customizable*. You can build beautiful surveys without having or being a designer, which will perfectly fit your website's colors and style. The possibilities are plenty: **Theme, Background color, Button text color, Question font size (px), Answer view, and dozens more!**


= RESTRICTIONS =
*Are you looking for trends, customer buying behaviors, or do you need to see beyond the big picture?* It is possible to do with the Survey Maker plugin. But, it is important to understand who is going to be **your target market**. One of the powerful functionality that our survey builder offers is the **Only for logged-in users** option. After enabling it, you will start to precisely target the audience, and not receive unneeded submissions from those, who have not signed in on your website. But it is not yet all, that our survey builder offers. It also has a functionality called the **Maximum number of attempts** per user. It will help you to not receive multiple submissions from the same respondent, which can cause a deviation from the accuracy of your results. The Survey plugin suggests two methods to prevent repeat voting from the same person. Those are the **Detect users by IP** or **Detect users by WP user ID**.

= Create smart and interactive surveys (Pro) =

Create a survey using the **jump logic (skip logic)** function and don't annoy the participants with unrelated questions. Due to this feature, the system will automatically select which question to ask based on the participants' answers.
As far as the surveys are mainly used as a questionnaire, create **anonymous surveys** and give the participants a chance to stay private and share their honest opinion with you.
Survey Maker gives you the ability to make the surveys more engaging for the users. Just activate the **chat mode** option, and the users will have the feeling of having a face-to-face chat with the device.
All the above-mentioned options are available for the [premium version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/survey-maker?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=ays-plugins&utm_campaign=survey)
