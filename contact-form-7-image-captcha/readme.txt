Adds a clean image captcha to Contact Form 7

== Description ==

Add an SVG image captcha and honeypot to your contact form 7 form. This CAPTCHA is GDPR compliant and becuase the images are inline SVG's, this plugin will not slow down your site with additional header requests like Google's ReCAPTCHA and respects your users privacy.

= Directions [PLEASE READ] =
Add the shortcode [cf7ic] to the form editor where you want the captcha to appear.

If the CAPTCHA appears in the wrong language, you will need to change the language of your contact form itself, this can be done either by using a plugin or by re-creating the form while your primary language is set in your sites settings.

You can hide the CAPTCHA until a user interacts with the form, by adding "toggle" to the shortcode.
`[cf7ic "toggle"]`

**Like the plugin?**
**Please consider leaving a review.**

As of version 3.2.0, **Contact Form 7 Conditional Fields** is now fully supported! You no longer need to add `[hidden kc_captcha "kc_human"]` to forms that do not include the [cf7ic] shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the image CAPTCHA showing the wrong language? =

Contact Form 7 sets your form language based upon your sites language settings. If you created your form when it was set to English, then the CAPTCHA will appear in English, this can be corrected by re-creating the form while your primary language is set in your sites settings, or you can try using a plugin like Contact Form 7 Multilingual or Contact Form 7 Polylang extension.

= How do you add the image CAPTCHA to the forms? =

Simply add this shortcode `[cf7ic]` to your contact form

= How do you use the toggle feature? =

To make it so the CAPTCHA only shows when the form is being filled out, add "toggle" to the shortcode `[cf7ic "toggle"]` in your contact form.

= Toggle is not working =

The most likely reason the toggle is not working is because the double quotes around the word toggle has been changed to "smart quotes", meaning that they are opening and closing quotation marks and not the verticle lines.

To fix, simply delete the quotes and re-add them with your keyboard - do not copy and paste.

= Why does the image CAPTCHA not appear? =

If the Image CAPTCHA does not appear, please confirm that you are running PHP version 7 or higher.

= Why does the styling of the image CAPTCHA look wrong? =

If the styling does not look right, you may need to clear your browser cache. If you have any caching plugins or speed optimization plugins installed, you may need to clear your site cache as well.
