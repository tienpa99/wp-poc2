== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is my data safe? Is Happyforms HIPAA compliant? =

Our competitors claim to be HIPAA compliant, but that‚Äôs misleading. Those dodgy buggers! Why have a compliant form if your site‚Äôs server, connected services and chosen inbox aren‚Äôt?

To keep things simple, we say to disable Happyforms from saving submissions and instead point replies to an email address hosted by an end-to-end encrypted email service like ProtonMail.

It‚Äôs easier than it sounds. Promise. Hit us up if you have questions.

= Does it work on a site not using WordPress? =

Nope. Sorry! We‚Äôre for all things WordPress ‚Äòround here.

Yep! We always recommend building forms on a desktop, but you can fill out a form anywhere ‚Äî mobile, tablet and desktop.

Sadly no longer compatible with your 90s Tamagotchi.

Yep! Happyforms directly connects with reCaptcha, Google Analytics, ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, Mailchimp, MailerLite, MailPoet, SendFox, SendGrid, Sendinblue, Stripe, PayPal, Zapier, Integrately and Integromat.

Through Zapier, Integrately and Integromat, you can connect with services like Shopify, Kajabi, QuickBooks, Xero, WooCommerce, FreshBooks, Gumroad, Gmail, Slack, Discord, Twilio, Google Drive, Dropbox, Google Docs, Evernote, OneDrive, Airtable, Teachable, GitHub, ClickFunnels, Facebook Pages, Google Calendar, Trello, Calendly, Klaviyo, Asana, Basecamp, HubSpot, Zoho, Acuity Scheduling, Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom, Wrike, ClickUp, Freshdesk, LiveChat, Drift, Jira, ScheduleOnce, Pipedrive and thousands more.
