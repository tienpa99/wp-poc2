== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you read my replies? =

Heck nah! No one likes peepers. All submissions are saved in your WordPress database or sent to your inbox.

Note: you'll need to upgrade to our paid contact form builder plugin to get some of the best goodies mentioned here.

= Can I translate forms into my language? =

Absolutely! Every last word read by your submitters can be translated — just type and replace. No extra plugins. No code changes. No fuss.

Note: you'll need to upgrade to our paid contact form builder plugin to get some of the best goodies mentioned here.

Note: you'll need to upgrade to our paid contact form builder plugin to get some of the best goodies mentioned here.

= Is my data safe? Is Happyforms HIPAA compliant? =

Our competitors claim to be HIPAA compliant, but that’s misleading. Those dodgy buggers! Why have a compliant form if your site’s server, connected services and chosen inbox aren’t?

To keep things simple, we say to disable Happyforms from saving submissions and instead point replies to an email address hosted by an end-to-end encrypted email service like ProtonMail.

It’s easier than it sounds. Promise. Hit us up if you have questions.

= Does it work on a site not using WordPress? =

Nope. Sorry! We’re for all things WordPress ‘round here.

= Do I need to know how to code? =

Nope. Happyforms has a fancy drag-n-drop builder. But if you find yourself needing to code something, email us. We can help you out with the nerdy stuff.

= Does Happyforms work on all devices? =

Yep! We always recommend building forms on a desktop, but you can fill out a form anywhere — mobile, tablet and desktop.

Sadly no longer compatible with your 90s Tamagotchi.

= Can I connect Happyforms to my favorite services? =

Yep! Happyforms directly connects with reCaptcha, Google Analytics, ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, Mailchimp, MailerLite, MailPoet, SendFox, SendGrid, Sendinblue, Stripe, PayPal, Zapier, Integrately and Integromat.

Through Zapier, Integrately and Integromat, you can connect with services like Shopify, Kajabi, QuickBooks, Xero, WooCommerce, FreshBooks, Gumroad, Gmail, Slack, Discord, Twilio, Google Drive, Dropbox, Google Docs, Evernote, OneDrive, Airtable, Teachable, GitHub, ClickFunnels, Facebook Pages, Google Calendar, Trello, Calendly, Klaviyo, Asana, Basecamp, HubSpot, Zoho, Acuity Scheduling, Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom, Wrike, ClickUp, Freshdesk, LiveChat, Drift, Jira, ScheduleOnce, Pipedrive and thousands more.

= What types of forms can I build? =

Just about anything. A contact form, intake form, registration form, survey form, quiz form, payment form, newsletter form, giveaway form, fundraising form, donation form, nomination form, order form, questionnaire form, onboarding form, contract form, estimate form, research form, qualitative form, quantitative form, membership form, mobile form, feedback form, release form, inquiry form, request form, evaluation form, RSVP form, reservation form, sales lead form, popup form, quote form, event form, booking form, application form, agreement form, safety form, compliance form, assessment form, sponsorship form, report form, file upload form, satisfaction form, volunteer registration form, personality quiz form, calculator form — you name it.

Abso-freakin-lutely! We’re always checking to make sure Happyforms plays nicely with popular themes like Divi, Astra, Avada, Genesis, GeneratePress, Enfold, Flatsome and OceanWP, and popular plugins like Yoast SEO, Elementor, WooCommerce, Jetpack, Wordfence, UpdraftPlus, MonsterInsights, WP Super Cache, Smush, W3 Total Cache, Loco Translate, SiteOrigin and Popup Maker.
